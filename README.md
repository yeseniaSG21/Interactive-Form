# Interactive-Form

  This form collects information from users to register for a "Full Stack Conference". There is a section for basic info, conference t-shirt info, and what workshop the user would like to attend. The final part of the form will direct the user to pay for the conference along with any workshops they choose.

Using supplied HTML and CSS files, I added a JavaScript file to make the form more user-friendly by: Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity. Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

If a user tries to submit empty or invalid, we prevent the form from submitting. When all the required fields are filled out correctly, the form submits (the page refreshes on its own when the submit button is clicked).
